My main support came from my amazing partner, Roel. We’ve been together now for 15 years but this experience pushes even a good relationship to the brink. There were times I thought we weren’t going to make it through. Outside of friends and family, I used the services of Breast Cancer Care. It was valuable to have another outlet for worries and questions without burdening those close to you even more. I first used the on-line forums to seek information and via that I found out about their Younger Women Together conferences. I attended the one in Nottingham just after finishing active treatment. It was a 2 day event held in a hotel with other ladies diagnosed who were under the age of 45 years. It was a fantastic event, so much support and positive information to help make sense of things when nothing made sense anymore. I would highly recommend these to anyone eligible. I also used the “Ask The Nurse” service which was a shining light at a dark time for me.

"'I was diagnosed in November 2019 at 31 years old. I remember the surgeon and Breast Cancer Now confirming it was cancer. I cried and kept saying my husband is away and I have a 3-year-old - will I see her go to school? I love her so much and don’t want to leave her. 'I phoned my husband and the devastation, crying and realisation between us at that point changed our lives forever. 'My mum was looking after my daughter and I rang to tell her to carry on as normal as I needed time to process and not let my daughter know. How I drove home is beyond me. My parents live an hour away so my dad (who was at his home) went to tell my two beautiful sisters and drove down to be with me and my mum. Seeing their faces and realising the heartbreak I had caused has still left me with guilt now. 'Two days after diagnosis they saw us again to confirm it was grade 3 stage 2 HER2+ with lymph node involvement. Hearing it again was just an extra kick in the stomach. I wasn’t prepared for this at all. 'I started chemo on 20 December. We had tried to freeze my eggs and two days before the harvesting they decided I needed chemo more. We were heartbroken. I also had the genetic test which I was so worried about having a daughter, two sisters, and a niece. I didn’t want this for them. I was relieved when it came back negative but a little part of me thought why me? 'I had three weeks of radiotherapy and now continue with a range of medication daily, monthly Zoladex injections, and three weekly Herceptin. My journey is far from over and for me the day-to-day now active treatment is over is the hardest. I am back to work as a teacher and the sense of purpose and ability to forget is wonderful. However, my confidence with weight gain from the medication, the mastectomy, infertility, and loss of hair are a battle I am trying to fight daily as well mentally. I am so privileged to have a wonderful family around me and I’m trying to not live in fear of recurrence and live for the moment.

"Janet shot these beautiful photos to truthfully document her breast cancer experience. 'I was diagnosed with breast cancer last January which you can imagine was a huge shock. I felt well and never thought it would be me. I started treatment straight away, but after my first chemotherapy session, I developed a problem with the wound from my lymph node surgery, meaning I couldn’t then continue my course of chemo treatment. Unfortunately, one treatment was enough to kickstart all of those side effects of chemo — I lost much of my hair over the course of several weeks. I had used the cold cap and had hoped this wouldn’t be the case, but all it did was draw out the process so every time I washed or brushed my hair it came out. 'For the next six months, I continued with targeted therapy drugs and had surgery, and during this time my hair started to grow back. At the beginning of September, I restarted chemo to have the remaining five sessions. I didn’t bother with the cold cap as it hadn’t worked for me before, so I lost my hair again quite quickly. 'I hate how I look without hair. I just don't feel like myself, particularly as my eyebrows have gone too. I have a wig but mostly wear hats and scarves, and never go out with my head uncovered. 'I had my final chemotherapy six weeks ago, and my hair has started to regrow slowly. I wanted to document this chapter of my life, but I didn’t want ""proper"" photos taken, in good light and all of me in. I don’t like to see myself in that way and wouldn’t want to share that with everyone. My passion is photography, so I decided to try to do this myself in my newly built studio. I had an idea for images that just hinted at how I looked, so I researched how I would light them. Technically it was a difficult exercise, setting up the focus, and lighting, but I was pleased with the results. I’ve had such positive comments from people about these pictures it has really boosted my confidence in how I look, although I’m still not ready to go out with a naked head just yet!' You can see more of Janet's photography on her Facebook account: https://www.facebook.com/janetmilesimages/ Many people will lose either some or all of their hair as a result of treatment for breast cancer.

"In July 2019, I was referred for a mammogram. Then I was told I needed an ultrasound. Three hours after I initially arrived at the hospital, I was told I had breast cancer. 'The following day, the consultant rang to say they would like to do a routine bone scan. Fast forward a few weeks and it was confirmed the cancer had spread to my ribs. I had secondary breast cancer. 'Physically, I felt well. Early menopause was emotional, but it had to happen for the treatment to work. When I was first diagnosed, one of my head and neck consultants said, ‘When your treatment settles down you will almost forget about it and get on with your life as normal.’ That’s pretty much where I’m at now.' - Victoria",1,0

It's hard to get used to looking in the mirror and seeing your body changing week by week. 'When you hear the word 'cancer', everything feels so scary. 'One of my friends has recently been diagnosed, and one of the pieces of advice I've given her is not to be afraid. 'Treatment is difficult, but there are so many support options out there to help you through. Being honest with yourself about how you're feeling, and with those around you, will make it easier.

"I had a lumpectomy to remove my tumour and surrounding tissue and sentinel lymph node removal in April 2019. The following week, I went back for my follow up appointment to be told I needed further surgery. Thankfully, I didn't need chemo - but I did need radiotherapy, and I will have to be on tamoxifen for 10 years. 'I found it difficult to sit still and rest when I had my operations as I’m usually such an active person. Then, a few weeks after my treatment, the fatigue hit me. It was the strangest thing I’ve ever experienced. Some days I was fine, then the next it was like being hit with a ton of bricks. 'At first, it was difficult to adapt my mindset, as I have always been the person who just did everything myself instead of asking for help. As a mum, you think it is sometimes easier to just do it yourself. I now realise it is important to allow people to help you, it is not a weakness to ask for help. It is hard for family and friends during treatment to know how to help, so let them do what they can. 'My children were fab throughout as we were very honest with them. They were so caring, helping around the house. My daughter took on the role of my nurse (which was so cute) bringing me my medicine and pain relief when needed. 'I have always been a very resilient person. Since my diagnosis, I have found things challenging at times - but I remind myself that what I've been through is huge, so I shouldn’t be too tough on myself. 'This change of attitude has also made me reassess what I want from life. Before my diagnosis, I was preparing myself to further my career but, on reflection, my priorities have now changed. I have decided to put this on hold for the moment so that I can focus on my family and my full recovery.' - Aisling",1,0
"‘Our fears were confirmed. The tumours had spread to my lymph nodes. The New Year was going to mark the start of my breast cancer treatment. ‘Simon and I drove home stunned. In a way, we were expecting it, but it couldn’t be real, could it? ‘We knew we had to tell the children. Simon had to medically retire when his kidney transplant was failing. He’d been on two modes of dialysis, and our lives and what Simon was able to do had changed drastically. ‘We had always been honest with the children about Simon’s health. We looked for books to help us explain the changes in our lives but had been unsuccessful. We used our own knowledge and experience to answer the difficult questions. Why does Daddy’s arm buzz? Why does Daddy have a tube coming out of his tummy? Why can’t Daddy carry me anymore? ‘This time around, the breast care nurse had given us a book for each of the children, Mummy's Lump, published by Breast Cancer Care. It help them understand what breast cancer was, and what was ahead. ‘It’s only fair to explain things to children. It’s the way they learn and come to terms with the situations they face. We knew from our experience with Simon’s illness that they would be less fearful about the procedures if they knew what was happening. ‘When we got home, we sat them down and told them about my diagnosis. We explained what cancer was, that they couldn’t catch it, and that none of us caused it. We also told them that the doctors had said they could treat me with medicine, surgery and X-rays. ‘We gave them big hugs and answered their questions.’ - Anita Anita shares her experience and five tips for telling children about breast cancer with us.

"I found a lump in my right breast in November 2019. After a mammogram and several ultrasounds, I was told I had a cyst. It was drained and I was sent on my way.

On May 14, it was biopsied, and I wasn’t given a diagnosis until the 26th. That wait was so hard.

People at Wave Walkers socialise and support each other. The members come from a range of backgrounds and parts of London. But we’re all there to paddle, have fun and get fit.

'So began a different journey to the one I had envisaged. A very lonely journey. One that would leave me exhausted, unwell and facing a future that I had not expected.

'Within weeks, instead of looking for a new job – which had been one of my resolutions – I was saying a tearful goodbye to colleagues to go into treatment.

All the people, women and men, were due to start chemotherapy in March, hence we became the ‘Marvellous Marchies’. 'I showed my sister the video and said I may write a blog about ‘My lonely journey’.

Some days I did not feel at all like going out, but I would make myself take at least a few steps. '3. Dealing with sad thoughts.

"'My partner, Iain, and I were then taken into a room. A consultant told me, ‘I’m sorry, you have breast cancer. 'Our world fell apart. It didn’t seem real, I felt like they were talking about somebody else. I felt completely numb. I was scared for my boys and my future. 'I tried to keep things as normal as possible. I carried on doing the school run and also kept as active as I could. There were some days where I wasn’t able to get out of bed, too, but on days I felt well, I walked my dog and met up with friends for lunch. 'It was important for me to keep some sense of normality – not just for me, but for my boys, my family and my friends.

"24 hours before my chemo was due to start, I got a phone call saying it wasn’t going ahead due to the pandemic. That was a blow. Instead they said they would do the mastectomy first but weren’t sure when that would be. ‘It’s been a rollercoaster as the plans were changing on practically a daily basis, with dates in two weeks, six weeks, six months, all suggested and then cancelled. I felt I was stuck in limbo with the cancer still inside me. When the plan changed again and I finally had a mastectomy, it was a shock. At that point there was no discussion of a reconstruction at all, that option was taken off the table. So while I’ve now had the mastectomy and the cancer has gone, which I am so grateful for, I couldn’t have reconstruction at the same time. ‘I’ve lost my confidence, I don’t know how to dress for my shape, I don’t feel like going out on my own and I just don’t feel have like I had any control over my treatment plan. Now I’m concerned that when this is all over there will be such a backlog of referrals for reconstruction there will be a big delay.’ - Nadine Like Nadine, over 1,500 breast cancer patients are facing “many months, possibly years” without reconstruction, as the backlog caused by the pandemic worsens pre-existing delays.

"'I found a small lump in my breast and I was diagnosed with breast cancer. They were fantastic and removed my lump within a week. But I was now on a journey like a train that you can't get off and my lymph nodes were found positive. My chemo started in January 2016. It was tough, it drained me of energy and my legs didn't work. I struggled to walk a few hundred meters and realised, reluctantly, that Ride The Night 2016 needed to be put on hold. The chemo zapped all the strength from my legs and damaged the nerves in my legs and hands, so riding my usual bike wasn’t going to happen.

"'I was diagnosed in 2011 when I was 33. I didn't have a specific lump, but my left breast was swollen. All my life, I've always been very breast aware as my mum died of breast cancer when I was young. I immediately went to my GP and got a referral, but was actually misdiagnosed for a few months and told it was mastitis. 'It wasn't until I kept going back - as it kept getting bigger and bigger - and finally broke down in tears that I was given a biopsy and then told it was breast cancer. 'My immediate reaction was fear. I was terrified I was going to die. 'The day following my diagnosis, I saw a fertility doctor to talk about fertility preservation. Unfortunately, following conversations with my oncologist and the fertility specialist, it was decided that delaying my treatment for a round of IVF to freeze embryos was too risky and I started chemotherapy three days later. This was another blow. 'I tried to stay positive and read lots of stories of people who went on to have children following their treatment. However, following my last chemotherapy, I went back to see the same specialist who ran a series of tests and told me that they indicated that I had been left infertile and that I would never be able to have children. I was devastated. 'I don't really know how I managed the news. I cried a lot. I had counselling. It was so hard as all of my friends were having children. 'Then, three years after being told I couldn't have children, I got some news. Because of a complication due to my Tamoxifen, I ended up seeing a gynaecologist in London. She said that the tests I had following my chemotherapy wouldn't have been valid so soon after my treatment, so I took them again - and this time I was told that there actually was a chance that I could have children. 18 months later, I had my baby boy!

"‘Moving forward’ is an awkward phrase. Time marches on for all of us, whether we appreciate it or not. But a breast cancer diagnosis brings with it many losses. In my case it was the loss of a breast, loss of the head of hair I once had, loss of a sense of youth and immortality, loss of aspects of my self-image and femininity, and loss of control over my body and destiny. Like all major losses, these have to be grieved. 'Three and a half years on from diagnosis, I am still very much a work in progress, but most days I am too busy to think about it. The threat of recurrence still hovers over me, but I have learnt to live with it. The deafening roar of imminent danger has become, for now, a distant hum. Of course there are triggers that turn up the volume from time to time, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Like it or not, cancer is part of my story. 'I recognise that my body image has taken a major blow and if there were more hours in the day I would stick to a fitness regime and perhaps eat more healthily.

"Grief is the emotional suffering you feel when something you have a bond with is taken away. But how on earth do you grieve for a breast? 'How do we grieve for the loss of a body part? An aspect of our intimate anatomy? There’s no funeral service, no eulogies, no publicly acknowledged period of mourning, no closure. You go to sleep on a hospital trolley with two breasts and wake up with one, or both, absent. 'Some women opt to remain flat after their surgery. This may be a medical necessity or it may be a deliberate choice, an embracing of the flatter, post-mastectomy body with a surgical scar as a symbol of the hard times endured and the difficulties overcome. Some women use tattoos to cover their mastectomy scars, as a way to reclaim their body from breast cancer. 'How do we grieve for that element of our identity that's tied into our physical body? Even though I'm not someone who places all my sense of value in my physical appearance, I still have to deal with the fact that post-op I am different. 'There is less of me. Some of me is in a different place from where it used to be. I am transformed. I, and the thousands of women who face similar surgery, are not less than we were before. But I am not the same physical being I was before the surgery. That is unalterably true and will always affect who I am. 'Grief is different for everyone. I suspect, as with the death of a loved one, the grief of what has been lost physically and emotionally will never go away completely. 'Grieving for what we lose through cancer is hard.

I made an appointment with my GP who referred me for a mammogram and biopsy straight away. I got the sense that something wasn’t quite right. 'I’ve got no idea why I waited. I was working in the City and felt like I didn’t have time. Perhaps I was scared to find the lump as well, because what if it was cancer? I was living in denial. 'The biopsy confirmed that it was oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. I had a full body scan to start considering treatments, which revealed that the cancer had also spread to my liver. I was told that I had incurable secondary breast cancer. 'My dad had cancer and passed away seven years ago, so I knew a bit about his diagnosis. But although I knew about breast cancer, I associated it with older women. I was 34 years old at diagnosis. None of my immediate circle of friends have had breast cancer. I’m the first in the friendship group and hopefully the last.' - Louisa Louisa was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in April 2017, four years after her father died from cancer.

"""I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer two days before Christmas 2019 during my annual mammogram. I underwent four rounds of chemo and thirty rounds of radiation. I completed treatment last Friday! There were many tears and anxiety was high during treatments with not being able to have my best friend/husband by my side. What has helped me so much is posting my journey on my Facebook page as well as joining a few breast cancer Facebook groups where I connected with other women going through their battles. I was blessed with so many prayer warriors and true heroes in the medical field. Although I’m through the treatments, I still have follow-up appointments this month to evaluate if cancer is gone or not. There’s still the concerns of COVID during these visits but I will remain hopeful and prayerful that i'm doing everything possible to keep well. I’m still not able to visit friends, family, and travel. 2020 has been a rollercoaster but it's a very big year for me and my husband.

I had gone for my annual appointment and the doctor sent me for a mammogram as I had turned 40 in June. I had no idea I had cancer. Six days later I realized I missed my period. That was the scariest moment in my life! I thought ‘now what? What are we going to do?’ It was a planned pregnancy but not under a diagnosis of cancer. I met with some of the most amazing doctors! I had an oncologist, breast surgeon, OBGYN, and a high-risk doctor. Together, and with the support of my partner Doug, we embarked on the scariest journey of my life! I went through 10 rounds of treatment while pregnant. I’m also a mom to two older boys (10 and 6) and was petrified of the risks. On June 17th, Jaden Douglas was born a healthy baby and he was truly the light that came from the darkness. Our family was now complete! I continue to fight my cancer. I had a double mastectomy on July 16th and started chemo again on September 2nd. I will then start radiation and proceed to have full reconstruction. Cancer doesn’t have to be the end. I hope my message can help other pregnant cancer patients so that they know they are not alone! There is a light and that light will shine brightest after the dark.”",1,0

Every week I see my oncologist and have chemo and I have been doing this for 5 months straight. It will be weird not having that as part of my routine - it's a safety net of sorts. I am starting to emotionally process what I’ve been through. Healing is not linear. But I am moving forward and I will certainly be celebrating this victory.

"""Because of COVID-19, I met my oncologist for the first time via Zoom. I remember sitting at my kitchen table with my husband before the doctor logged on thinking about how inappropriate and impersonal it was to be having this discussion over Zoom. I already knew I would need chemo because my mammogram result was high risk and I had micrometastasis to one lymph node but I had a really hard time getting over the Zoom part of it. It actually turned out fine, my oncologist is wonderful. She took the time to explain everything, answered all of my endless questions, and validated my feelings that the Zoom meeting was an unfortunate way for doctors and patients to meet for the first time. I worked up until the day before chemo started, it kept me sane and my mind occupied with something other than cancer. Once chemo started I couldn’t work because the risk was too high given COVID-19. Fortunately, I’m in a position where I’ve been able to just stay off work and take this time to focus on me. But I’m looking forward to going back and just filled out my schedule starting October 1st!""",1,0

I then had to go through a month of radiation followed by a lumpectomy. I would tell someone who has just been diagnosed that it gets better.

I had no idea it was there and I believe it was divine intervention. I decided on an aggressive treatment option and endured a bi-lateral mastectomy and chemo. Fast forward to October 2019. While chatting with my husband, I randomly brushed my right breast by accident when I leaned over a piece of furniture and something felt weird. I had not had a mammogram in over 14 years or seen my breast cancer doctors since I was released as cancer-free. So, I scheduled an appointment to have it checked. To my complete surprise, I was diagnosed with HER2+. Once again, I decided on aggressive treatment including chemo, a lumpectomy where I already had less than 5% breast cancer tissue remaining, 33 radiation treatments, and Herceptin and PERJETA every three weeks for 6 months.

"Vanessa was diagnosed at age 27 with stage 3B invasive ductal carcinoma. ""I had a bilateral mastectomy, chemo, and radiation. At that time, our daughter was almost 4 years old. She laughed as I shaved my head. She loved the hats and scarves I wore. She was my reason to fight, along with the strength only God could give, and the immeasurable support from my sweet husband, Mom, and in-laws. Around 4 years cancer-free, we were able to adopt our second daughter. Great things can come through hard times! The adoption of our son took place about 4 years after that. Had it not been for the hard times we faced with breast cancer, we wouldn't have known the joy it is to adopt! Fast forward almost 10 years after the original diagnosis and I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. We immediately started with new meds and more targeted radiation. A lot has changed after receiving this diagnosis. We moved back home closer to family and friends and really slowed down the pace of life. We are enjoying the day to day. My oldest daughter is now a senior in high school and I see the strength she has through seeing us fight cancer head-on. Today I'm about 15 months out with no evidence of active disease, since my second treatment. I choose to overcome cancer every day with my faith, attitude, thoughts, and overall enjoyment of life.""",1,0
"Kim just celebrated one year cancer-free with her very own parade! It was an emotional day, full of love and support, as cars drove past honking and waving in celebration. She sent this message to our team: ""Seems like yesterday I was diagnosed. It all happened so fast. My support team was huge and I will never forget the day I received my HOPE Kit. It was one of the first days that I was alone, since being diagnosed, and I cried. When I received my kit, it reminded me that I wasn’t alone at all. This is the exact reason why in October I asked the Everett Public Schools to host a fundraiser on behalf of National Breast Cancer Foundation. We raised over $2,000.00 and I couldn't think of a better foundation to send it to."" Congratulations, Kim! <3",1,0

"Jayna's mother, Sharon, was diagnosed with breast cancer last April. She underwent a bilateral mastectomy as part of her treatment plan and began experiencing back pain during her recovery. It came as a shock when she was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer that spread to her bones. ""My mom went through 10 rounds of radiation to her spine, taking a chemotherapy pill, and anti-hormone therapy. One year later, she is humbly and proudly NED (no evidence of disease). She has always been my biggest supporter, my constant in the ups and downs of life, and the hardest part for her was telling me her diagnosis just two months after I was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. Yes, February 24, 2019, I was diagnosed after having uncontrollable abdominal pain. She was my number two (of course my husband was number one until he had to return to work) caregiver after my hemicolectomy and liver resection. She was and still is my biggest support system because we understand each other so much from our experiences with cancer. I’m so blessed and thankful to have her for my mother and to still have her by my side fighting the good fight!!! I love you, mom. Forever and always."", Jayna shared.",1,0
"""I have been fighting breast cancer for a year and that has made me really know fear, hope, life. I always try to see the glass half full instead of empty. It's helped me come to terms with the loss of hair, nails, breasts, eyebrows, eyelashes, serenity, safety, and a lot of fear. Fear of not making it, physically and psychologically. I'm focused on the little milestones in life. Today, seeing my hair less than an inch long gives me an incredible feeling of freedom and victory, which only those who go through this can understand. Always look for something that makes you feel better even on the worst days."" We are inspired by Martina's story and words of encouragement and would love to hear about your small victories.

"Alison shared, ""I always gain about 20 pounds when I do chemo rounds consecutively. This has been true since my very first rounds. Some people lose weight from cancer and chemo, but many are surprised to find they gain during chemo. Yet another way you start to feel less like yourself when you look in the mirror. You lose your hair, you lose your eyebrows and eyelashes and you can start to see that fullness that has an artificiality to it...I start to feel less like myself, and then I remember that I am not my body. Like this reminder from @kerridenell, “Your body is a miracle.” My hairless, puffy body is fighting for my life. It is strong and resilient. After I see the initial changes, I don’t spend a whole lot of time thinking about it. I have more important things to think about. I notice it for a few when I pull on pants that are now a bit more snug. I notice it when I put on a fitted tank, and my upper stomach starts to stick out a bit more than the ribs that show where my breasts used to be. I notice little love handles that weren’t there just a few weeks ago. But I am just so dang thankful to HAVE a body. I am here. I HAVE a body. And I love it.""",1,0
"""Yesterday felt like the first time I thanked my body since this quarantine started. After cancer, I promised myself to do things differently. To treat my body good, not to over work, to take time to workout and eat right, drink less, take more me time. COVID-19 took care of the work, then the rest of my goals spiraled. Literally have done NONE of this since quarantine. All my goals of self-care for this year went out the window when I let negativity camp out on my brain. I’m easily affected by people's energy, and can get so consumed I shut down. Yesterday I chose to get outside, do a small workout, cook healthy, do a face mask, took a bath, choose tea over wine. No matter what your bank account looks like, how stocked your fridge is, how high the bill pile is, take even 10 minutes for yourself today thanking your body for all the work it’s doing. You deserve it. Keep going friends, let’s come out of this still kicking!""",1,0

"""Facing breast cancer has made me more honest. Honest with myself, who I am, who I want to be for my daughter, and what I am capable of. Once you face your own mortality, being honest with yourself and everyone else seems so easy. I was diagnosed at the age of 33 with Stage 3 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer. I was 32 weeks pregnant. I had no idea how to be a mom, let alone, a mom with cancer. Upon diagnosis, it was decided that my daughter, Savannah, would be born a month early via c-section, and I would have a bilateral mastectomy only ten days later. Needless to say, the healing process was monstrous, but Savannah was born healthy and no NICU was needed. While I had this beautiful newborn baby, I couldn't properly bond with her. I was not permitted to breastfeed before my mastectomy, and afterward, I was not permitted to hold her, lift her, or carry her. I was terrified that my early motherhood experience was a failure. Six months of chemotherapy followed and then 33 rounds of radiation...all while having a newborn. The number of times that I broke down were numerous, but I was honest with myself in knowing that how I was feeling was 100% normal. Through the flood of negative emotions: fear, anger, denial, and hatred, I realized that I had to let it all go and realize that I was fighting for my daughter and no longer for me. Today, we are both happy and healthy. We overcame the odds together. I know that through my daughter, I will see the world for what it is and the beauty that it holds each and every day.""",1,0

"""I was diagnosed in 2006 from a routine mammogram. I was 45 and a mom to a 15-year-old, a 12-year-old, and a 9-month-old baby. I had neglected to get my mammogram years prior and, in 2006, I was trying to get things somewhat regulated with my gynecologist and she reminded me that I needed to schedule a mammogram. I went and I got a call to come back in for more pictures. Soon after, I needed to go back in for a biopsy. Honestly, I was a bit aggravated because I’m a teacher and I didn’t really want to take the time off. Also, I had no family history of breast cancer so I didn't think there was anything to be concerned about. Unfortunately, my biopsy came back cancerous and I was diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer. I had a partial mastectomy and radiation treatment. By the grace of God, I have been cancer-free since March of 2007! I call my surprise baby boy my messenger baby because, had I not been having some issues from the pregnancy, I probably would have skipped my mammogram again. Ladies, please stay on top of your mammograms! Mine saved my life.""",1,0

"On National Mammography Day, we share this important reminder from Lillie Shockney. ""For those of you who were scheduled for a mammogram between March 2020 and now, you were likely instructed to delay your screenings until the COVID-19 pandemic is in control or possibly even over. This doesn't mean that your mammogram isn't important and necessary. Your healthcare providers want to keep you as safe as possible. So when the time comes, please get rescheduled for this important screening test. Also, you should still be doing your monthly breast self-exam. Look for changes from last month to this month and, if you find something, then see your provider. He/she might even want you to get a diagnostic mammogram just to ensure all is well. Healthcare facilities, including breast imaging facilities, are taking great measures to keep you safe.""",0,1

"“Cancer doesn’t discriminate. It affected me and it affects families, friends, neighbours and colleagues,” says Susan Penney. After being diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2007, Susan was in total shock. “All I heard was 6 months to 2 years to live.” After intense chemotherapy and radiation, Susan has been in remission for 10 years. Now, Susan works in our Newfoundland office as a health promotion and cancer prevention educator. One of her duties includes working in the resource room, which fits clients with prostheses and wigs. Men, women and children of all ages and backgrounds visit the resource room. “Thanks to advancements in research, I am alive and healthy today - but countless others have not been as fortunate. We need to support research so that we can better treat and prevent cancer.” 1 in 8 Canadian women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.

"For people with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), there are limited treatment options – but thanks to a Canadian Cancer Society Innovation to Impact Grant, Dr Raymond Reilly’s work is changing that. Dr Reilly and his team are pioneering a groundbreaking technique that could save the lives of people with TNBC, a highly aggressive cancer. Currently, people diagnosed with TNBC can receive chemotherapy, but the treatment often stops working as the cancer becomes resistant. Dr Reilly’s promising new technique uses gold nanoparticles to help amplify and target radiation specifically to TNBC tumours – boosting the effectiveness of the treatment and reducing side effects.

"“I was diagnosed with breast cancer three weeks after my father’s death in the spring of 2003. I had discovered lumps while taking my morning shower. A core biopsy would confirm not one, but two types of breast cancer in one breast. Surgery, chemotherapy and radiation would follow. My mother was a breast cancer survivor and I have written a cheque for the breast cancer cause every year since my mother was diagnosed, but I never thought that I’d be going through what she’d gone through 15 years earlier. That fall, I remember the day of the CIBC Run for the Cure. I was coming from the grocery store and I was bald and realized I couldn’t drive down the street because it was roped off. I saw all these people in pink run by and I started to cry, because I realized that they were running for people like me.
