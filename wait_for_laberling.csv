,"It is with great sadness we share that Wollongong doctor and Illawarra ambassador for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, Dr Margaret Gardiner passed away on Friday with her three sons Gerald, Edward and Dominic Riordan by her side. Margaret was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2000. Margaret fought breast cancer in private, but also in public. She was inspiring advocate in the Wollongong area raising awareness and funds for research for over 15 years. She founded the annual Wollongong Mother‚Äôs Day Classic event, turned the iconic lighthouse pink, and held countless fundraising events to support breast cancer research. Margaret was role model for many women who, like her, refused to let breast cancer dictate their lives. Margaret was relentless in her battle to ensure that one day nobody is forced to face cancer, and she was passionate in her belief that every cent donated to research brings us a step closer to a cure. Her love, strength and passion will be fondly remembered and greatly missed, and is a driving force for us to continue to push forward with our mission. Margaret‚Äôs lasting legacy is the research she made possible through her tremendous fundraising efforts which we are forever grateful for. Our thoughts are with her boys as we know how dearly she loved you. A special tribute page has been set-up by her family for those wishing to make a donation in her memory. https://give.everydayhero.com/au/drmargaretgardiner",,,,,

We were lucky to have some wonderful friends help us through. Thankfully, mum is doing really well now. She has the pleasure of watching her grandchildren grow up. I have also been tested for the genetic marker, and while I don't have it, I am still cautious and get tested every two years.

Dr Alessandra Muntoni, Director of Research Investment at the National Breast Cancer Foundation said that the research grant scheme with the Movember Foundation is an innovative approach that is in line with the evolving landscape of medical research. ‚ÄúOur collaboration with Movember really symbolises a giant leap forward for funding Australian cancer researchers in a particularly challenging funding landscape‚Ä¶ These grants will really give Australian cancer researchers the ability to take their research to the next level,‚Äù said Dr Muntoni.

,"Sharyn Chain bravely took on a head shave challenge in front of hundreds of women at the Hardy's Bay Pink Ribbon Luncheon in October to raise money for NBCF after being inspired by our researcher Professor Patrick Brennan. ""I have been going to the Hardy's Bay Pink Day Luncheons for 6 years. Last year two best friends spoke about one carrying the others baby because she was not able to carry herself due to chemotherapy, it really touched me and brought me to tears.Then when professor Patrick Brennan spoke of how every cent of money raised helps with research I just knew I wanted to do something more myself the following year."" ""I went to have my haircut by my friend and hairdresser Kylie Fox and she told me her mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. At that moment I asked Kylie if she would shave my head at the next Pink Luncheon to help raise extra money on the day. I set out with a goal of $5000 and tried to reach that target before the day. I ended up raising over $10,000 for the Hardy's Bay Pink Luncheon to add to their total, making the grand total $33,000.00! It was a very emotional and humbling experience.""

,"What does this microscopic image of cells show? . . This image of breast epithelial cells (the cells that form the inner lining of the milk duct, where breast cancers may develop) was produced by one of our funded researchers, Associate Professor Andrew Burgess. Excitingly, these cells are grown in a 3D culture, allowing them to form spherical clusters, which better represents the cellular environment within a tumour. Associate Professor Burgess found that breast epithelial cells have increased cell growth when they have high levels of a protein known as MASTL, which may contribute to breast cancer invasion and metastasis (or spread). Although the findings still need to be validated in clinical trials, these preclinical results suggest that MASTL may be targeted in future therapies to prevent tumour growth and metastasis, and thereby improve patient survival.

,"NBCF-funded researcher Dr Philip Gregory believes the key to treating and preventing metastatic breast cancer is in understanding exactly how it occurs. His team has identified a specific molecule that blocks triple negative breast cancer growth ‚Äì one of the hardest to treat subtypes of breast cancer, which presents a higher chance of metastasis. This molecule acts by suppressing many different growth pathways at the same time ‚Äì stopping breast cancer from advancing.

Her husband - who is currently being treated for prostate cancer and small lymphocytic leukemia - has lost 8 of his siblings mostly to lung and brain cancer. His surviving sister has throat cancer. Norma lost her mom to stomach cancer, her sister to sarcoma and her cousin to leukemia. Her son has survived aggressive leukemia, her daughter has lived through melanoma and both children continue to undergo routine, follow-up testing. Outside her family, 2 close friends have battled breast cancer and 6 others have died of cancer. Norma is passionately involved with multiple cancer charities as a volunteer and fundraiser. She has participated in the CIBC Run for the Cure and has been a door-to-door canvasser during Daffodil Month and volunteer and participant in Relay For Life. ""My hope is by raising money for research, they can find new ways to fight cancer, catch it earlier or make it a disease you can live with. We need to support research into all causes of cancer in order to save lives.""

In the past, regions of DNA outside of genes were sometimes considered just ‚Äújunk.‚Äù Researchers now realize that these regions can act as switches and ‚Äúdimmers‚Äù to control gene activity.

,"Thanks to innovative research, we‚Äôre making progress in improving treatment and quality of life for those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a type of highly aggressive breast cancer. TNBC is considered hard-to-treat because the tumours often become resistant to standard chemotherapies and are difficult to target with existing breast cancer drugs. Dr Mathieu Lupien and his team discovered a unique feature of TNBC that can be used to slow tumour growth. They found that TNBC cells have a high level of a protein called GLUT1, which fuels their rampant growth. Despite this, not all TNBC tumours respond to a drug that specifically blocks GLUT1. When the researchers looked into why, they found a genetic marker that could distinguish between tumours that are vulnerable to anti-GLUT1 drugs and those that are resistant. By using this genetic marker, researchers could identify people with TNBC who would benefit from GLUT1-targeting drugs, offering them a tailored treatment option for their cancer. We‚Äôre so grateful to partners like SpongeTowels who help us fund groundbreaking breast cancer research like Dr Lupien‚Äôs and share our vision of creating a world where no Canadian fears breast cancer. ‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,,

Tara chose to have a double mastectomy -- but with that decision came the knowledge that her body would never be the same again. After much consideration, Tara opted to have breast reconstruction surgery on both her breasts. ‚ÄúWhile I didn‚Äôt lose myself while facing cancer, having the disease made me feel like I misplaced something,‚Äù says Tara. ‚ÄúDeciding to have reconstructive surgery helped me get that piece of me back. I could finally feel like myself again.‚Äù This Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we‚Äôre sharing stories of women who chose to have breast reconstruction after their mastectomy. Tara is among the 16% of Canadian women who have immediate reconstruction following mastectomy.

,"Miriam, a four-time cancer survivor was diagnosed with her first cancer in December 2010 as her family was preparing for the holidays. One of their traditions was having a big family dinner on Christmas Eve, however that year, Miriam was scheduled for surgery that day. How did the family cope? To keep things as festive and traditional as possible, they held their family dinner a few days early. And they gathered in smaller groups after her surgery to help her recover. The holidays can bring about challenges for those recently diagnosed with cancer, living with cancer or coping with the loss of a loved one. We‚Äôre here to help.

,"On average, 75 Canadians will be diagnosed with breast cancer every day. Screening tests can help find breast cancer before you‚Äôve even noticed symptoms ‚Äì which is why it‚Äôs important to be informed about your breast cancer screening options based on your age and other risk factors. A mammogram is an x-ray image of the breast that can help find both cancerous and non-cancerous tumours in the breast. While women 50 to 74 should get mammograms every 2 years, those at high risk for breast cancer may need to be tested more often and at an earlier age. With early detection and routine screening, breast cancer can be treated early and with more success.

In some cases, biomarker levels predicted a tumour before it could be felt under the skin.

,"Susan Walsh understands just how much a cancer diagnosis can instantly change your life. Susan‚Äôs cancer was first detected in 2012 when she noticed a bruise on her right breast. Initially thinking that she simply bumped into something, she ignored it. When she noticed the same bruise over a month later, Susan felt there was something wrong and decided to go see her doctor. Soon after, Susan heard the words ‚Äúyou have cancer.‚Äù To treat her breast cancer, Susan had chemotherapy, a lumpectomy and 33 rounds of radiation. Then, in 2016, 4 ¬Ω years after her initial diagnosis, she learned her cancer had metastasized to her bones. Treatment this time included intense concentrated radiation treatments and a chemotherapy regimen which she continues to this day to prevent further growth of her cancer. ‚ÄúFar too many people are touched by cancer and that‚Äôs why I believe research is essential. It is the answer to saving lives like mine. We all have to rally together and fight as a community,‚Äù says Susan. #BCAM #metastaticBC",,,,,
,"Many proteins in cells are naturally modified with a chemical tag that can turn them on and off. Some cancers have abnormal tagging patterns.

This technique will help researchers learn more about how to diagnose and treat many types of cancer. #BCAM #cancerresearch",,,,,
