# narrative
This is the GitHub repository for the narrative detector on social media. I designed a machine learning-based detector of narratives in social media posts around the topic "breast cancer." The logic is straightforward based on Narrative and Persuasion Theories in communication science: detecting Who (a persona), When (past period), What (a topic or an event), and Punctuation (declarative sentence vs. interrogative sentence vs. imperative sentence). Please check out the documentation and code for more details and our ideas. Thanks.

The release of the complete source code and the large-scale Facebook post/comment textual data set that I used is subject to the permission of my collaborators.
